            <br>
            <strong>Gintoki Sakata</strong> (坂田 銀時, Sakata Gintoki) is the main protagonist
             of the <em>Gintama</em> series.
             He is the founder and president of the Yorozuya, as well as a highly-skilled samurai, having
             fought in the Joui War in the past. During the war, he became known as the Shiroyasha
              (literally meaning "White Yaksha", a kind of demon in Buddhism and Hinduism) due to his 
              powerful swordsmanship, demonic appearance, white clothing, and silver hair.
